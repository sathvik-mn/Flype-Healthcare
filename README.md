The database is based on a tool that Nick Miller has worked on called Flype. It consists of a relational database, in-house developed bioinformatics analysis pipelines, a connection framework to connect to external tools, and a web interface to provide easy and efficient access to the information stored in the database. The relational database stores things like patient information, sample and result information, result interpretation, and other information needed to provide quick and personalized healthcare.
